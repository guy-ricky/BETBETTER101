## Tactical Notes & Predictions
- Chelsea may take a more cautious away approach: control possession, limit errors, and break when space opens.
- Spurs could press high, win second balls, and force Chelsea into mistakes—especially if concentration dips.
- **Prediction**: A tight affair; perhaps a draw (1-1) or Spurs edging it (2-1) if Chelsea’s errors persist.

## Looking Ahead
This fixture is more than three points—momentum and confidence are on the line. A positive result would steady Chelsea; a Spurs win would set a strong tone for November.

## Final Thoughts
London derbies always carry extra spice. Chelsea must tighten up mentally and defensively to avoid another late sting. Spurs will sense vulnerability and try to capitalise. Expect intensity from the first whistle.
