## What to Watch
- **Burnley’s approach:** Likely a compact 5-4-1 formation, disciplined defensively, and looking to counter through pace. [Source 2]  
- **Arsenal’s mindset:** The Gunners aim to maintain momentum and extend their lead at the top, but history shows November has tripped them up before — and this month begins with three straight away games. [Source 3]  
- **Key battle:** Burnley’s defensive structure vs Arsenal’s fluid front line. Can the Clarets stay organised and deny space in wide areas?

## Tactical Notes & Predictions
- Burnley must minimise mistakes and remain well-organised deep into the second half.  
- Arsenal will seek early control of possession and tempo to silence the home crowd.  
- **Prediction:** Arsenal edge it narrowly, perhaps 1-0 or 2-1, though Burnley’s tenacity could keep things close.

## Final Thoughts
A classic clash of intent: Arsenal’s rhythm and precision versus Burnley’s grit and structure. Expect intensity from both sides and a reminder that in the Premier League, no away day is routine.
