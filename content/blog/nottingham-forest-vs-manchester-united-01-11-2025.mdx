## What to Watch
- **Forest’s woes**: Striker Chris Wood is ruled out with a knee injury, leaving Forest short of a reliable focal point up front. Defensive instability may also hurt them here. [Source 2]  
- **United’s momentum**: Under new coach Rúben Amorim, United look sharper, with better balance and improved pressing compared to previous seasons.  
- **Key player to watch**: United’s wide attackers — especially the right-sided forward — who can exploit Forest’s defensive gaps on the flanks.

## Tactical Notes & Predictions
- United are likely to dominate possession, stretching Forest horizontally and creating overloads out wide.  
- Forest may sit deep, compact between the lines, and attempt to break through quick transitions.  
- **Prediction**: Manchester United to win, likely 2-0 or 3-1 if they maintain their current tempo and precision in attack.

## Looking Ahead
A win for United would strengthen their claim as genuine contenders again and boost morale heading into a tough November schedule. For Forest, another defeat could highlight the need for reinforcements and defensive reorganisation before the winter run-in.

## Final Thoughts
This fixture offers United a chance to consolidate form and confidence. Forest must stay disciplined, compact, and clinical if they are to steal points. On paper and in form, the edge lies firmly with the visitors.
