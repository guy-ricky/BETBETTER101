## Tactical Notes & Analysis  
### Manchester United  
- **Front-three fluency:** Cunha’s movement between the lines and Mbeumo’s direct running stretched Brighton, creating high-quality transition looks.  
- **Set-/second-phase pressure:** United repeatedly won second balls around the box; the Casemiro goal typified that persistence.  
- **Game management:** A brief lapse invited Brighton back in, but United’s response in stoppage time showed growing resilience under Amorim.

### Brighton  
- **Late threat:** The Seagulls improved with fresh legs and set-pieces down the stretch.  
- **Defensive gaps:** Early phases were too open; fullback/half-space coverage broke under United’s quick combinations.  
- **Positives to keep:** Their press still forced turnovers; the late surge shows there’s attacking bite to build on.

## Impact on the Table  
- **Manchester United:** The victory moves United **up to 4th**, strengthening their Champions League push and marking a third straight league win.  
- **Brighton:** The defeat leaves Brighton around **12th**, hovering mid-table and needing a response to stay in touch with the European-chasing pack.

---

## Player Highlights  
- **Bryan Mbeumo (Man United)** — Tireless, decisive, and clinical with a late dagger for his brace.  
- **Matheus Cunha (Man United)** — First United goal; clever positioning and link play throughout.  
- **Casemiro (Man United)** — Anchored midfield duels and pounced for the second.  
- **Danny Welbeck (Brighton)** — Sparked belief with a fine free-kick against his former club.

## Looking Ahead  
United’s momentum under Amorim grows: the attack is knitting together and the table position reflects it. Brighton’s task is clear—tighten the defensive structure earlier in matches and turn late pressure into points.

---

## Final Thoughts  
A chaotic finish couldn’t derail a signature United performance built on intensity, verticality, and end-product. If they bottle this formula, the top-four trajectory looks very real. Brighton, meanwhile, showed enough late menace to suggest a quick rebound is possible with sharper control of early-game phases.
