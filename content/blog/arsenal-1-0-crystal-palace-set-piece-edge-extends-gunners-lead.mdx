## Match Overview  
On Sunday 26 October 2025, at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal hosted Crystal Palace and secured a **1-0** win thanks to a first-half set-piece masterpiece from Eberechi Eze — his first league goal for his new club, and coming against his former side.

---

## Timeline & Key Moments  
- **39'** — Arsenal earned a free-kick taken by Declan Rice; it was headed on by Gabriel Magalhães to Eze, who volleyed it into the bottom corner.  
- After that, the match became a battle of attrition: Palace pressed and defended well, but Arsenal remained compact and disciplined. Despite limited clear chances, the Gunners held firm.  
- Late in the game Arsenal weathered a few moments of pressure — the clean sheet now adds to their defensive credentials.

## Tactical Notes & Analysis  
### Arsenal  
- The win exemplifies Arsenal’s ability to grind out results when needed: minimal chances created (reported xG ≈ 0.9) but clinical when the opportunity came.  
- Set-piece effectiveness continues to be a strength: the goal came from a well-executed dead ball.  
- Defensive solidity: The clean sheet marks another strong defensive display, vital for a title challenge.  
- Slight concern: Injuries to key figures (Saliba, Rice) emerged during the match. Their fitness will be crucial going forward.  

### Crystal Palace  
- For Palace this was a defeat not for lack of effort but for lacking the cutting edge: they entered the match well-organised, yet conceded from a set-piece and couldn’t find the breakthrough.  
- The result halts momentum slightly and pushes them back to mid-table, meaning their climb will need steadier wins.  

---

## Impact on the Table  
- With this win, **Arsenal extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points** ahead of the chasing pack.  
- Meanwhile, **Crystal Palace drop to around 10th place**, staying mid-table but losing ground in the European qualification chase.  
- In practical terms, Arsenal’s win is a “six-pointer” — boosting their own tally while denying momentum to potential challengers. The Gunners look increasingly like genuine title contenders, while Palace’s hopes of climbing higher will depend on improved consistency.  

---

## Player Highlights  
- **Eberechi Eze (Arsenal)** – A meaningful goal against his former club; composure and technique on display.  
- **Gabriel Magalhães (Arsenal)** – His header assist was the catalyst for the goal; dominant in the air.  
- **Declan Rice (Arsenal)** – Delivered the free-kick that unlocked the match; continues to lead midfield tempo.  
- **Crystal Palace squad** – Despite defeat, they showed organisation and grit but lacked the finishing touch.  

---

## Looking Ahead  
- **Arsenal** must sustain this form through a busy schedule across multiple competitions. Keeping key players fit and maintaining defensive focus will be vital to stay top.  
- **Crystal Palace** will aim to bounce back quickly: a few wins could pull them back into European contention.  
- **Title picture:** Arsenal’s steady results are beginning to create separation — pressure now shifts to Manchester City, Liverpool, and others to respond.

## Final Thoughts  
This was the type of win champions build: narrowly controlled, precisely executed, and mentally tough.  
For Arsenal, it could be a statement victory — moving from hopeful challengers to clear frontrunners.  
For Crystal Palace, it’s a setback but far from a crisis. With discipline and sharper attacking transitions, they remain a threat to any side.
