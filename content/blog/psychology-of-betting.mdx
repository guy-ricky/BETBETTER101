Even experienced bettors fall victim to **emotional decision-making**.

We’re wired to seek reward and avoid loss, which can cloud judgment.
Understanding these patterns is essential to long-term success.

### Common Psychological Biases

1. **Loss aversion** — losses hurt about twice as much as equivalent wins feel good.  
2. **Confirmation bias** — we search for information that supports our predictions.  
3. **Gambler’s fallacy** — believing past outcomes affect future probabilities.

To counter these, build **systems**: pre-set staking plans, stop-loss limits,
and strict record-keeping.
